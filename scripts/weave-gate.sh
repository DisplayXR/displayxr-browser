#!/usr/bin/env bash
# weave-gate.sh — decide whether a Chromium rebase can auto-publish or needs a human
# hardware eyeball (browser#37, decision #2 on browser#33).
#
# THE RULE
#   PATCHED  = existing Chromium files our patch series MODIFIES
#   UPSTREAM = files Chromium changed between the old and new tag
#   RISK     = PATCHED ∩ UPSTREAM
#   RISK empty  -> AUTO-PASS. Upstream touched nothing we patch, so after re-applying the
#                  series our weave-bearing code is byte-identical to the build that was
#                  last validated on hardware. A green build cannot have broken the weave.
#   RISK nonempty -> HOLD. Our edits landed on code upstream moved; a human eyeballs the
#                  weave on real hardware before this ships.
#
# WHY THE PATCH SERIES AND NOT docs/integration-points.md:
#   The doc's `⚠ Edit` lists are prose (nested brace-expansion, line-wrapped, sometimes
#   partial paths). Mis-parsing it would silently SHRINK the risk set and fail OPEN — the
#   one failure mode a safety gate must not have. The patch series is authoritative (it IS
#   what we edit), self-maintaining (a new patch updates the set for free), and needs no
#   prose parsing. Files our patches ADD are excluded automatically: upstream doesn't have
#   them, so they can never appear in UPSTREAM.
#
# FAIL-SAFE: any error, empty input, or unknown state exits HOLD (2), never PASS.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/weave-gate.sh --old 150.0.7871.24 --new 150.0.7871.129 [--src C:/cr/src]
#   scripts/weave-gate.sh --old X --new Y --changed-file <precomputed-list>   # for tests/CI
#
# Exit: 0 = AUTO-PASS · 2 = HOLD (human eyeball) · 3 = usage/internal error (treat as HOLD)
